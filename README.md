# twitter_app_final
To launch the app, visit https://twitter-app-final.herokuapp.com.

This is my first ever web app. I built the back-end using Ruby and collabroated with a fellow coder hanapotski for the front-end.

The app is deployed via Heroku. It makes a call to the Twitter API to retrieve tweets that fulfil the following criteria:
- tagged with #pixelart
- contains a static image
- created within 24 hours of launching the app

The collection of tweets are then ordered according to the number of likes with the top ten most-liked tweets making it on to the webpage.
